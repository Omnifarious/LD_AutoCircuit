## LD AutoCircuit

--------------------------------------

This mod adds a shortcut toggle (like the roboport toggle) that toggles
whether or not circuit wires are automatically strung to a newly placed
long-distance pole when you place the pole such that it connects to
another pole that already has circuit wires attached.

This is useful for running circuit wires all along your rail network or
over other long distances.
